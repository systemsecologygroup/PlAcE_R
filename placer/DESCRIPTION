Description: Methods to estimate plastic accumulation using R. The package quantify the
    confidence intervals for the prevalence of plastic debris in seabird's nests as a 
    function of different sample sizes. Although, our focus is on seabirds, these methods
    can be use to quantify plastic accumulation in other organims.
